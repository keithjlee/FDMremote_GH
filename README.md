# FDMremote_GH
FDMremote provides a series of Grasshopper components for Tension/Compression structure form-finding using the Force Density Method. It provides a set of native components for the analysis of small to medium networks, but also provides a communication link to its sister package, [FDMremote.jl](https://github.com/keithjlee/FDMremote), for extremely fast one-time analysis and multi-step optimization. Client-server communication is made possible by integrating the work of [Behrooz Tahanzadeh](https://github.com/behrooz-tahanzadeh) and his [Bengesht](https://github.com/behrooz-tahanzadeh/Bengesht) plugin for Grasshopper.
